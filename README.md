>An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program.

A Logo interpreter written entirely in Swift. Curretly supports logo syntax with basic builtin commands such as `forward`, `back`, `left`, `right`. It contains playground with samples below. Have fun! üê¢
