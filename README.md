>An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program.

A Logo interpreter written entirely in Swift. Curretly supports logo syntax with basic builtin commands such as `forward`, `back`, `left`, `right`. The language reference 
and very basics of how it works are described in my [blog post ](https://wojteklu.com/post/writing-a-logo-interpreter/). You can play with interpreter using created [macOS app](https://github.com/wojteklu/logo/releases).
